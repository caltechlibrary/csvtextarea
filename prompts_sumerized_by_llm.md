Summary of the prompts and the key features we've developed for the `CSVTextarea` component:

1. **Initial Request**:
   - You asked for a web component for working with tabular data in a web form.

2. **Basic Structure**:
   - Created a custom element `<csv-textarea>` with attributes like `rows`, `cols`, `column-headings`, `show-header`, `max-rows`, and `readonly`.
   - The component allows editing CSV data directly in the web form.

3. **Dynamic Rows**:
   - Added functionality to dynamically add rows up to a specified maximum.
   - Implemented the ability to add a new row when "Shift+Enter" is pressed in the last cell of the last row.

4. **Event Handling**:
   - Added event listeners for cell changes and form submission.
   - Ensured the CSV content is included in the form data when the form is submitted.

5. **JSON Conversion**:
   - Added a method `toJSON` to convert the CSV content to JSON format.

6. **Column and Row Interaction**:
   - Implemented methods to update and retrieve cell values based on column names or indices.
   - Added functionality to select all text in a cell with "Ctrl+A" and all text in a row with "Ctrl+Right Arrow".

7. **Clean Up Rows**:
   - Added a "Clean Up" button to remove empty rows.
   - Implemented the ability to trigger the cleanup of empty rows with "Shift+Backspace".

8. **Info Tooltip**:
   - Added an info icon (â“˜) in the upper right corner that shows a tooltip with a short explanation of the component and lists the key bindings.
   - Ensured the tooltip content includes the component's name attribute as a heading and the title attribute content (if set).

9. **Title Attribute Handling**:
   - Ensured that changing the `title` attribute does not trigger the `attributeChangedCallback` method.
   - The `title` attribute is used in the tooltip to provide additional context for the component.

10. **Key Bindings**:
    - Summarized the key bindings in the tooltip:
      - Shift + Enter: Add a new row.
      - Shift + Backspace: Clean up empty rows.
      - Ctrl + A: Select all text in the current cell.
      - Ctrl + Right Arrow: Select all text in the current row.
      - Backspace: Delete selected text in each cell.

These features and enhancements have been incrementally added based on your requirements and feedback, resulting in a robust and user-friendly `CSVTextarea` component.
