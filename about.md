title: csvtextarea
abstract: "CSVTextarea is a web component designed to work with tabular data. When you embed the element in a form or web page the innerHTML of the element was be treated as CSV data and then 
displayed in a table structure. If you use the component in a web form you may need to handle encoding and submission through the form&#x27;s submit event handling. CSVTextarea has many 
attributes in common with a traditional textarea and a textarea can be used as a fall back if JavaScript or components are not available.

The goal of this web component is to provide a simple mechanism for working with multivalued fields that easily map to a simple column and rows representation."
