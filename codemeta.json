  "description": "CSVTextarea is a web component designed to work with tabular data. When you embed the element in a form or web page the innerHTML of the element was be treated as CSV data and then \ndisplayed in a table structure. If you use the component in a web form you may need to handle encoding and submission through the form's submit event handling. CSVTextarea has many \nattributes in common with a traditional textarea and a textarea can be used as a fall back if JavaScript or components are not available.\n\nThe goal of this web component is to provide a simple mechanism for working with multivalued fields that easily map to a simple column and rows representation.",
