NOTE: Below is prompt I used to start the conversation with Mistral in creating the proof of concept web component.

I need to create a web component called CSVTextarea. 

- The web component will be used to enter tabular data
- The data will be represented using CSV encoding
- The number of columns should be configurable 
- The maximum of rows should be optionally configurable
- If web component should fallback to a plain textarea if JavaScript is unavailable
- The user should be able to add additional rows as needed up to any specified maximum
- The web component needs to support data provided to it in a textarea in CSV format
- The web component needs to support W3C recommendations for accessibility

I would like the filename defining the web component to be called "csv-textarea.js".

I would like an HTML file called "index.html" to include a web form to test the component.

I would like a simple Deno web server to test the web component in Firefox web browser.
